# Changelog

## 0.0.3

- Minor tweaks, but includes fixing the events, which were all using
  clickEvent.

## 0.0.2

- Renamed to web_notifications, which more correctly reflects the name
  of the spec it's implementing, and is less likely to be confused
  with other sorts of notifications.

## 0.0.1

- Initial implementation of Notification, using JS-interop
